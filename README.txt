the file that contains data is 1.mat , it contains 10 movements recorded in 4 channels , each movement is recorded following this structures : 3 seconds of the movement , 3 seconds of relaxation and we repear this operation 3 times

How to train the model :
Run signalTrain.py

How to run realtime prediction :
-  Run the server that simulates the signals recording of the 4 sensors : - run server.py
and run the client and prediction file : run RealtimePatRec.py
